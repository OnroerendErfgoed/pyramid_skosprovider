0.5.0 (2014-12-19)
------------------

- Conceptschemes expose information on the subject they're tagged with. [BartSaelen]
- A new search endpoint for searching across conceptschemes was added. Search
  syntax is the same as for searching within a single scheme, but the collection
  parameter is not accepted. Two extra parameters were added for limiting the
  search to a subset of available conceptschemes. (#8)
- A new endpoint for looking up a certain URI was added. This endpoint does not
  redirect to an external URI, but lets a client know where more information
  about this URI can be found (eg. in which conceptscheme a concept lives). (#7)

0.4.0 (2014-10-23)
------------------

- Compatibility with skosprovider 0.4.0
- Drop support for Python 2.6 and Python 3.2.
- Expose notes on collections.
- Expose matches on concepts (collections don't have matches).
- Expose subordinate_arrays on concepts and superordinates on collections.
- Integrate concept scheme information. Concepts and collections passed through 
  the service now contain the uri of the concept scheme they belong to. The 
  concept scheme endpoint now also exposes information like a uri, a list of 
  labels and notes.

------------------

- Expose information about top concepts.
